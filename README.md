# Prit Patel, Jaimeen Sharma
# Milestone 1
###### I started by setting up a colab notebook and a github repository. The drive was then mounted. I was given a github URL that I can use to clone the files. Linked my github to colab and create a folder called "Project" on MyDive. After that, I created a new branch called "Milestone1" and moved the files I copied from the provided github URL. I used git to add, commit, and push branches to github. I adhere to the instructions provided in the assignment to install NNI.
